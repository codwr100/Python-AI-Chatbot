# Python-AI-Chatbot
I wanted to create a simple rule based ChatBot using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).It can engage in basic conversations, answer questions, and respond to user inputs based on predefined patterns created.
Its built to be customizable allowing users to easily modify code to add their own patterns and modify the output given by the chatbot.

You may wonder how it works, and ill explain that it matches user input against its own list of predefined patterns to determine which one to reply with.
